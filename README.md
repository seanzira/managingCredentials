# managingCredentials

## Project details
This project was made to deal with credential management, from user registration to user login, all the way through to managing the credentials (dependant on what your role is as the user - normal, management and admin).

## Usage
Upon running the app, you will be exposed to a menu that has options for the user to either register or login, as well make change to the users role, credentials etc.

## Installation
To access the app, the user would have to download all the files within this directory, then install the node modules. Once that is done, the user then has to open their command prompt in the project's directory and run the command prompt "npm start", after running the server code and seeding it with the available seeders.
